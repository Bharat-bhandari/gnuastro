Gnuastro release checklist
==========================

This file is primarily intended for the Gnuastro maintainer and lists the
set of operations to do before making each release. This should be done
after all the commits needed for this release have been completed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is currently a draft, it will be complete with the 0.2
version release.

 - Update the NEWS file (use `git log --reverse gnuastro_vA.B..HEAD').

 - Check if README includes all the recent updates and important features.

 - Check if THANKS is up to date and include recently updated
   people/institutions.

 - Update the library version in (`lib/Makefile.am'). See the `Updating
   library version information' section of the GNU Libtool manual as a
   guide.

 - Commit all the changes and tag the commit.

 - Make sure all the bootstrapping tools are up to date (keep the versions
   somewhere to use in the release).

 - `git clean -fxd'

 - `./bootstrap --copy --gnulib-srcdir=/path/to/gnulib'

 - `./tmpfs-config-make'

 - `cd build'

 - `make distcheck -j8'

 - Generate the GNU FTP upload script. This step and later steps will be
   added later.

 - Update the links on the webpage (`doc/gnuastro-top.html' and possible
   translations).

 - Build the full webpage (the `doc/forwebpage' script) and check if
   everything is OK after the upload.

 - Announce the release on `info-gnuastro@gnu.org', `info-gnu@gnu.org' and
   Savannah.
