Gnuastro release checklist
==========================

This file is primarily intended for the Gnuastro maintainer and lists the
set of operations to do before making each release. This should be done
after all the commits needed for this release have been completed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is currently a draft, it will be complete with the 0.2
version release.

 - Update the library version in (the values starting with `GAL_' in
   `configure.ac'). See the `Updating library version information' section
   of the GNU Libtool manual as a guide.

 - Update the NEWS file (use `git log --reverse gnuastro_vA.B..HEAD').

 - Include the library version in the NEWS file.

 - Check if README includes all the recent updates and important features.

 - Check if THANKS is up to date and include recently updated
   people/institutions.

 - Commit all the changes and tag the commit for the release.

 - Make sure all the bootstrapping tools are up to date (keep the versions
   in text file to use in the release).

 - `git clean -fxd'

 - `./bootstrap --copy --gnulib-srcdir=/path/to/gnulib'

 - `./tmpfs-config-make'

 - `cd build'

 - `make distcheck -j8'

 - Generate the GNU FTP upload script. This step and later steps will be
   added later.

 - Update the version numbers and on the webpage (`doc/gnuastro-top.html'
   and possible translations).

 - Build the full webpage (the `doc/forwebpage' script) and check if
   everything is OK after the upload.

 - Announce the release on `info-gnuastro@gnu.org', `info-gnu@gnu.org' and
   Savannah.
