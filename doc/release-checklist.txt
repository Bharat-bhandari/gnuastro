Gnuastro release checklist
==========================

This file is primarily intended for the Gnuastro maintainer and lists the
set of operations to do before making each release. This should be done
after all the commits needed for this release have been completed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is currently a draft, it will be complete with the 0.2
version release.

 - Update the library version (the values starting with `GAL_' in
   `configure.ac'). See the `Updating library version information' section
   of the GNU Libtool manual as a guide.

 - Update the NEWS file (use `git log --reverse gnuastro_vA.B..HEAD').

   - Also update the library version for this release in the NEWS file.

 - Check if README includes all the recent updates and important features.

 - Check if THANKS is up to date and includes recently updated
   people/institutions.

 - Commit all the changes and tag the commit for the release.

 - Make sure all the bootstrapping tools are up to date (keep the
   versions in text file to use in the release), then bootstrap and
   rebuild everything:

   $ git clean -fxd
   $ ./bootstrap --copy --gnulib-srcdir=/path/to/gnulib
   $ ./tmpfs-config-make
   $ cd build
   $ make distcheck -j8

 - Upload the tarball with the command below: Note that `gnupload'
   uses `ncftpput' which comes with the `ncftp' package. The replaces
   are necessary for the symbolic links.

   - For an alpha upload:

       $  /path/to/gnulib/build-aux/gnupload --to alpha.gnu.org:gnuastro   \
               --replace --symlink-regex="s/X.X.XXX-XXXX/alpha-latest/"    \
               gnuastro-X.X.XXX-XXXX.tar.gz

   For a stable release:

       $  /path/to/gnulib/build-aux/gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:gnuastro   \
               --replace --symlink-regex gnuastro-X.X.tar.gz

 - Update the version numbers and on the webpage (`doc/gnuastro-top.html'
   and possible translations).

 - Build the full webpage (the `doc/forwebpage' script) and check if
   everything is OK after the upload.

 - Announce the release on `info-gnuastro@gnu.org', `info-gnu@gnu.org' and
   Savannah.
