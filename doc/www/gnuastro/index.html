<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,
     with the SSI statements intact, from
     http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/boilerplate.html?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
-->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
        -->

<!-- If you would like to make sure your page validates with HTML5, that
     would be a good thing.  To do that, change the first line from
     to /server/html5-header.html before trying the validation.  Maybe
     someday we will be able to make /server/header be HTML5.  -->

<h2>GNU Astronomy Utilities</h2>

<p>The GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) is an official GNU package
consisting of separate programs for the manipulation and analysis of
astronomical data. All the various utilities share the same basic
command line user interface for the comfort of both the users and
developers. GNU Astronomy Utilities is written to comply fully with
the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/">GNU coding
standards</a> so it integrates finely with the GNU/Linux operating
system. This also enables astronomers to expect a fully familiar
experience in the source code, building, installing and command line
user interaction that they have seen in all the other GNU software
that they use.</p>

<h3 id="download">Downloading GNU Astronomy Utilities</h3>


<p class="cartouche"><b>We are working hard on the first release of
the source code as soon as possible.</b> To be informed when it is
released (and keep up to date with all future Gnuastro announcements),
please subscribe
to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnuastro">info-gnuastro</a>. The <a href="manual/">documentation
(manual)</a> is ready and available.</p>

<p>Gnuastro can be found on the main GNU ftp server: (not yet
activated)<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuastro/">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuastro/</a>
(via HTTP) and (not yet
activated)<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuastro/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuastro/</a>
(via FTP).  It can also be found on the <a href="/prep/ftp.html">GNU
mirrors</a>; please (not yet

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p><a href="manual/">Documentation (manual) for Gnuastro</a> is
available online in various formats, as
is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.en.html">documentation
for most GNU software</a>. After installing Gnuastro, you can access
the documentation for the full package or individual programs on the
command line,
in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info/info.html">Info</a>
format, by running any of the top three commands below for varying
levels of generality (the name in the top three is not case
sensitive):

<ul>
  <li><code>info gnuastro</code>: To view the complete GNU Astronomy
  Utilities manual.</li>
  <li><code>info ProgramName</code>: To view the complete section
    about ProgramName. For example <code>info NoiseChisel</code>
    or <code>info ImageCrop</code>.</li>
  <li><code>info astprogname</code>: To only view the "Invoking
  ProgramName" sub-section of the manual. Each program has this
  subsection which explains the input(s), output(s) and command line
  options for that particular program. For example <code>info
  astnoisechisel</code> or <code>info astimgcrop</code>.</li>
  <li><code>astprogname --help</code>: A description and full list of
  options (classified by context) for this program will be
  printed.</li>
  <li><code>man astprogname</code>: A man page listing the options and
  arguments of this program.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="mail">Mailing lists</h3>

<p>Gnuastro has the following mailing lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnuastro">bug-gnuastro</a>
is used to discuss most aspects of Gnuastro, including development and
enhancement requests, as well as bug reports.</li>
<li><a
href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnuastro">help-gnuastro</a> is
  for general user help and discussion.</li>
<li><a
href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnuastro">info-gnuastro</a> is
  for announcements made by Gnuastro developers for the user community.</li>
</ul>

<p>Security reports that should not be made immediately public can be
sent directly to the maintainer.  If there is no response to an urgent
issue, you can escalate to the general
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/security">security</a>
mailing list for advice.</p>

<h3 id="contribute">Getting involved</h3>

<p>Development of GNU Astronomy Utilities, and GNU in general, is a
volunteer effort, and you can contribute.  For information, please
read <a href="/help/">How to help GNU</a>. If you'd like to get
involved, it's a good idea to join the discussion mailing list (see

<dt>Development</dt>

<dd>GNU Astronomy Utilities is still under active development. So if
you are interested, please have a look at
the <a href="manual/html_node/Developing.html">Developing</a> chapter
of the documentation and start hacking into Gnuastro or even write
your own utility within it. If you feel you want to share your work as
an official section of Gnuastro, please contact the maintainer
(below).  For development
sources, <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=gnuastro">bug
trackers</a>, <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?group=gnuastro">task
