## Add the version numbers of the separate programs:
## ================================================= List the header
## files in this string with a space character between them, don't
## forget to add `$(top_srcdir}/src/` before them like the ones
## already there.

SHELL=/bin/bash


## Commands to make the texinfo tools:
info_TEXINFOS = gnuastro.texi
gnuastro_TEXINFOS = fdl.texi authors.texi utilityversions.texi formath.texi


## Files not predefined by Automake, and not in dependencies that must
## be included in the final tar-ball distribution.
EXTRA_DIST = findversions.sh README


## Generate a list of Gnuastro authors from repo history:
authors.texi:
	./genauthors


# Find the version of each utility:
headers=$(top_srcdir)/src/*/main.h
utilityversions.texi: $(headers)
	./findversions.sh $(headers)


## Images:
infognuastrodir=$(infodir)/gnuastro-figures/
dist_infognuastro_DATA = $(top_srcdir)/doc/gnuastro-figures/*
