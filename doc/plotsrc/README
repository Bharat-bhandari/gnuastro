This directory has all the necessary information to make the plots
that are to be drawn by LaTeX (TikZ) and will also convert all the
manual images to the necessary formats for all the Texinfo output
formats.

To do everything, simply run:

    make





PRACTICAL NOTES
---------------

1. When creating the final PDF files here (usually at the end of the
boostrapping step), you might get this error:

convert: attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy `EPS' @ error/constitute.c/IsCoderAuthorized/408.

If you do, go to `/etc/ImageMagick-7/policy.xml', and uncomment the line
with the EPS,PDF,etc.... policy limitations. It was apparently due to a bug
in Ghostscript that has been fixed since version 9.24
(https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/332928/).
