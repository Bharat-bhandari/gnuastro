GNU Astronomy Utilities library header files
============================================

This directory contins Gnuastro's library header files. Once installed, all
these directories will be installed in the specified
'$(prefix)/include/gnuastro' directory (the value of '$(prefix)' can be set
at configure time, see the "Installation directory" of the Gnuastro book
for more).

Inside of Gnuastro, the directory is given the same name to make Gnuastro's
internal code similar to what a user would use in their own programs once
the header files are installed.
