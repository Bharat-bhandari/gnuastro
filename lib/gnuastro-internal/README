GNU Astronomy Utilities internal header files
---------------------------------------------

The `.h' files in this directory are headers to Gnuastro's internal
libraries: libraries that are only available to Gnuastro's programs. These
are functions that are mainly to do with running a program, for example the
common options to all the programs, functions to manage options and
configuration files, timing and etc (the names are hopefully descriptive
enough).
