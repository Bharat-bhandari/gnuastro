GNU Astronomy Utilities (gnuastro)
===================================

GNU Astronomy Utilities are a set of utilities that enable you to do
astronomical data analysis directly from the command line in a system
that integrates fully with the GNU operating system.

Although the existing software for astronomical analysis are mostly
available under GPL, but they mostly lack the GNU standards in terms
of building, user interaction and a complete and uptodate manual. This
makes using such software for newcommers to astronomy very hard. GNU
Astronomy Utilities were made to provide the community with a set of
tools that will provide the astronomers with the quality standard of
GNU.

The packages that are currently included in gnuastro are listed below.
After the name of the package, the name of the executable is provided
which can be run after installation from the commandline.

ImageCrop      (astimcrop):   Crop from one or multiple images.
MakeProfiles   (astmkprof):   Make mock profiles.

More programs will be added as the community of developers grow.

GNU Astronomy Utilities comes with a complete manual in various
formats (plain text, info, docbook, PDF and HTML). You can get any of
the formats from the GNU Astronomical Utilities webpage. If you have
already installed gnuastro, you can see the manual by running:

    $ info gnuastro





Requirements
------------

To successfully get installed on your sytem, gnuastro requires the
following packages to be already installed:

GSL:             The GNU Scientific Library.
CFITSIO:         The standard tool for manipulating FITS files.
WCSLIB:          The standard tool for reading WCS coordinates.
LIBJPEG:         To manipulate JPEG images.
FFTW3:           C subroutines for discrete Fourier transform.

All of these programs can be easily installed with the standard GNU
build system.





Installing and running:
------------

To install gnuastro, after downloading or cloning it, all you have to

    # make install

See `./INSTALL` for a standard review of the GNU build and install
methods.

All the programs in GNU Astronomy Utilities use the standard GNU/Linux
commandline options for configuration. Running any of the executables
with the `--help` option for a complete list of options and a short
explanation of each.
