GNU Astronomy Utilities (AstrUtils)
===================================

AstrUtils is a set of utilities that enable you to do astronomical
data analysis directly from the command line. Using the most basic
shell features. It includes several packages which do various
operations on FITS files. The FITS standard is the data storage
standard in astronomy.

Although the existing software for astronomical analysis are mostly
available under GPL, but they mostly lack the GNU standards in terms
of building, user interaction (command line options) and Texinfo
manual. This makes using such software for newcommers to astronomy
very hard. The GNU astronomy utilities were made to provide the
community with a set of tools that will provide the astronomers with
the quality standard of GNU.

The packages that are currently included in AstrUtils are listed
below.  After the name of the package, the name of the executable is
provided which can be run after installation from the commandline.

Image Crop      (gauimcrop):   Crop from one or multiple images.
Image Stats     (gauimstat):   Statistics of an image.
Elliptical Mask (gauelmask):   Make elliptical mask from catalog.
FITS to JPG        (gauf2j):   Convert a FITS image to a JPEG image.
JPG to FITS        (gauj2f):   Covert a JPEG image to a FITS image.
Mock Galaxies     (gaumock):   Make mock galaxies in an image.

More programs will be added as the community of developers grow.

AstrUtils comes with a complete manual in various formats (plain text,
info, docbook, PDF and HTML). You can get any of the formats from the
GNU Astronomical Utilities webpage.





Requirements
------------

To successfully get installed on your sytem, AstrUtils requires the
following packages to be already installed:

GSL:             The GNU Scientific Library.
CFITSIO:         The standard tool for manipulating FITS files.
WCSLIB:          The standard tool for reading WCS coordinates.
LIBJPEG:         To manipulate JPEG images.
FFTW3:           C subroutines for discrete Fourier transform.

All of these programs can be easily installed with the standard GNU
build system.





Installing and running:
------------

To install AstrUtils, after downloading or cloning it, all you have to
do is to run the standard configuring, compiling and installing
commands that are common to all GNU applications. In the downloaded
directory (`$` as user and `#` as root):

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    # make install

See `./INSTALL` for a standard review of the GNU build and install
methods.

All the programs of AstrUtils use the standard GNU/Linux commandline
options for configuration, run any of the executables with the
`--help` option for a complete list of options and a short explanation
of each.
