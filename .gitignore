# Files to ignore in version control (Git)
# ========================================

# The files satisfying the patterns here (one per line) are ignored by
# the version control using Git, they are all outputs of the various
# tools used to built Gnuastro, so we don't need to keep their
# history.



# Glob patterns
# -------------

# The `*' can be replaced with any string. Any file that has a name
# satisfying any of these conditions will be ignored, irrespective of
# which directory it is in.

# Full file names to ignore
# -------------------------

# These are full file names. Note that the directory containing the
# file is irrelevant. Note that we cannot use a glob pattern for the
# utility names (since their configuration files would also be
# ignored).

# Directories
# -----------

# A name finishes with a slash (`/'), is treated as a directory and
# all files within that directory will be ignored. Therefore there is
# no need to say `foo/*'. Simply `foo/' is enough.
