# Files to ignore in version control (Git) -*- conf-unix -*-
# ==========================================================

# The files satisfying the patterns here (one per line) are ignored by
# the version control using Git, they are all outputs of the various
# tools used to built Gnuastro, so we don't need to keep their
# history.



# Glob patterns
# -------------

# The `*' can be replaced with any string. Any file that has a name
# satisfying any of these conditions will be ignored, irrespective of
# which directory it is in.

# Full file names to ignore
# -------------------------

# These are full file names. Note that the directory containing the
# file is irrelevant. Note that we cannot use a glob pattern for the
# utility names (since their configuration files would also be
# ignored).

# Directories
# -----------

# A name finishes with a slash (`/'), is treated as a directory and
# all files within that directory will be ignored. Therefore there is
# no need to say `foo/*'. Simply `foo/' is enough.

# When Git finds a slash in the end of an entry, it will immediately
# ignore the whole directory (and everything within it). This is more
# efficient then leaving it to try to fit patterns.

# NOTE: If ./bootstrap doesn't find the exact string value of its
# build_aux variable (that we defined in bootstrap.conf) here, it will
# add it to the top of this file (which we don't want). Unfortunately,
# the value of build_aux must not end with a slash (otherwise `make
# distcheck' will not be able to do its final tests). So only for this
# directory, we have abandoned the convention above.
