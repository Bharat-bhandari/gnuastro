User-visible changes in GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro)
==========================================================

Introduction
------------

The user-visible and significant changes in each official release of
Gnuastro are written here in reverse chronological order, even within each
category. So the recommended way to read the changes is from bottom to
top. All the changes have been blended in the text of the official Gnuastro
book. The most recent version of the book can be found in the link below:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/manual/

Therefore this file should be the main reference for experienced users who
are upgrading and want to learn what has changed since their last
version. The most recent changes have not yet been given a version
number. Further explanation on the changes can be seen in the version
controlled history of Gnuastro (see "Version controlled source" section of
the book). The parenthesis after each line contain the commit hash which
contains more information. The commit message can be seen with the
following command in the version controlled source.

    git log HASH

In the version controlled source, this file is not updated on every
commit. It is updated after an arbitrarily long period to incorporate
serveral recent changes. Please see "Synchronizing" section of the manual
on how to stay informed of the changes before each official release.
