Institutions
------------

GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) has greatly benefited from the following
institutions. These institutions have either funded, supported and most
importantly provided a productive environment for the developers of
Gnuastro. They finally disclaimed any copyright ownership of the
developers' work while in those institutions which allows the world wide
astronomical/scientific community to reliably use Gnuastro in the
future. See "Copyright assignment" section of the book for a complete
explantion on the importance this has for the community.
