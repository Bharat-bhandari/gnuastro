Great thanks to the following institutions and people
=====================================================


Institutions
------------

GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) has greatly benefited from the
following institutions. These institutions funded, supported and most
importantly provided a productive environment for the developers of
Gnuastro. They finally disclaimed any copyright ownership of the
developers' work while in those institutions which allows the world
wide astronomical community to benefit from their support.

In particular special thanks should be given to the Japanese Ministry
of science and technology (MEXT) scholarship, which funded Mohammad
Akhlaghi's five year Masters and PhD program in Tohoku University
Astronomical Institute. Without this long term scholarship (which
allowed long term and basic learning and planning), Gnuastro would not
have been possible.
