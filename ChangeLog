	* tests/basicchecks.sh: New file (common tests for all tests).

	* tests/Makefile.am (AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Corrected test
	environment.

	* src/imgcrop/ui.c (setparams): Moved all similar actions to the
	CHECKSETDEFAULTS macro in defaults.h

	* src/imgcrop/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): New (previously in
	AM_CFLAGS).

	* lib/defaults.c (addhomedir): Now returns char *.
	(writelocaldefaultstop): Informs the user of how to make the
	needed directory with `make -p`.

	* include/defaults.h (SAVE_LOCAL_DEFAULTS): changed addhomedir.
	(CHECKSETDEFAULTS): A new macro to read defaults.
	(END_OF_NOTSET_REPORT): Added some extra information.

	* doc/astrutils.texi: A lot of updates in the text! Listing them
	all would be too much!

	* configure.ac: `--with-numthreads` and `--enable-progname` were
	created along with all their necessary checks.

	* Makefile.am: Set conditional subdirectories. Added
	`basicchecks.sh` to the files to be distributed.
